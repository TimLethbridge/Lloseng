<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">A negotiation support system helps people, organizations or nations to agree on a contract, agreement or treaty. We are going to be using this as a case study during the course. Examples of negotiations include labor contracts between management and unions, contracts to do do engineering work, or treaties between countries (e.g. for trade, climate change).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Without getting into too much detail we will have to consider:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The <span style="color: #cf2a27;">parties</span> (who are negotiating) and any other users</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The <span style="color: #cf2a27;">structure of contracts</span> or treaties (sections, clauses, etc)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="color: #cf2a27;">Activities in negotiating</span> (e.g. declaring objectives, making proposals, making counterproposals, explaining reasons for proposals, indicating agreement)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="color: #cf2a27;">Types of proposals</span> (and counterproposals), such as new wording, edits to wording, moving wording from one place to another, renumbering, logic (either this or that; if you agree to this we will agree to that, etc.)</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;"></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">We want to do this in a very 'agile' manner, so we will try to develop the simplest possible iteration first, and then iteratively add features.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">We will think about it in very basic terms in units 2 and 3.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">We think about the requirements for it during unit 4</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">We will model the data for it in unit 5</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">We will discuss the user interface for it in unit 7</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">We will consider other aspects of its design in units 8 and 9</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">We will consider testing in unit 10</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The following is an example of a contract that I use in my capstone course:</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Capstone project agreement&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This Agreement is between the following Parties:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;(the &ldquo;Students&rdquo;) _________</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;(the &ldquo;Customer&rdquo;) _________</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">A. Whereas the Students are working on their Capstone project in Software Engineering at the University of Ottawa (Course codes SEG4910 and SEG4911) between January 2020 and December 2020;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">B. And whereas the Customer wishes the Student to develop Software (including elements such as requirements, architecture, designs, source code, scripts, servers, clients, websites, graphics, data and documentation) as part of their Capstone project;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">C. In consideration of the covenants contained herein, the Parties agree as follows:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Customer will provide such suggested requirements, support, data, review and feedback necessary for the students to develop the Software.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Student will work on the software at a rate of 10-15 hours per week for approximately 24 weeks (not consecutively, since there will be gaps in the summer, the university exam periods and at other times), for a total of 240-360 hours.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Customer agrees to let the Students manage progress of the project under the guidance of academic staff at the University of Ottawa.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Students will protect confidential information belonging to the Customer (and his/her company), except that they may reveal it on an as-needed basis to the academic staff at the University of Ottawa (the course professor and teaching assistant), who themselves will keep it confidential.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Students will maintain the confidentiality of the Software, except that they will reveal all aspects of it to academic staff at the University of Ottawa (who will maintain its confidentiality), and are able to reveal aspects of its top level goals, general architecture, user interface and challenges faced to other students in the Capstone course after consultation with the client about which specific elements may be shown.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">There is to be considered no employment arrangement in place between the Customer (or his/her company) and the Students with regard to the Software, although that does not preclude there being an employment relationship for other work performed by the Students for the Customer.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Students will do her best to complete the project to the customer&rsquo;s satisfaction, but cannot be responsible for delays or incomplete aspects caused by excessive numbers of requirements, excessive changes in requirements, unanticipated technical problems, the unavailability of the Customer, or similar causes.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Customer may from time to time change their requirements, and the Students will do their best to adapt the software to such changes.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Students will make best effort to fix any defects in the software when they are brought to their attention.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Students will prioritize changes to the Software based on the priorities requested by the Customer.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Students will design the Software in such a way that it can be maintained by others following the completion of this agreement.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Customer (or his/her company) will retain and assume intellectual property rights (including copyright) to the software.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Students will not be responsible for development or maintenance of the software beyond the end of December 2019 unless a separate agreement is signed, or this agreement is amended.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This agreement is separate from other agreements that may be in place between the Parties; in particular it does not cover development of non-software products sold by the Customer (or his/her company), marketing or artistic works (which would require separate agreements).</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Province of Ontario and the federal laws of Canada, as applicable.</span></li>
</ol>
