NOTES
---------------------------------------------------------------
The logs detailed in this document details the functionality of my code running
the OCSF Phase 2 Test cases. They include Test Cases from 2001 - 2013 and 2017. 

I was unable to run the Test Cases from 2014, 2015, 2016, 2018 and 2019 simply
because they all require two computers and currently, there is only one computer 
in my household.

Also, some of the messages displayed from certain connections/disconnections might
differ from what was intended in the assignment but I think you will still find 
that it functions the same.
